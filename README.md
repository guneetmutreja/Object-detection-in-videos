# Object-detection-in-videos
This repo includes notebook to show how using pretrained YoloV3 model object detction can be done on videos. In the notebook two ways are shown:
 - Extracted images from videos using opencv and used YoloV3 implemented in ArcGIS API for Python to detect objectf of interest like person, vehicle, etc.
 - Used predict_video method to detect objects directly on videos.
